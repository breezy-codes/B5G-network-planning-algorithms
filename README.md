## Code Repository

This repository contains the complete codebase for my **Honours year project**, based on research into cost-effective deployment and optimisation of next-generation (B5G/6G) reconfigurable RAN and optical X-haul networks. It includes implementations, datasets, and utilities for generating, analysing, and optimising network configurations.

Algorithms provided:

- **Greedy Algorithm:** Fast, heuristic-based solutions for initial network configurations.
- **Graph Encoded Genetic Algorithm with Steiner Mutations (GEGASM):** Evolutionary optimisation for exploring larger solution spaces, exploiting Steiner tree properties for efficient solution generation.
- **Graph Encoded Genetic Algorithm (GEGA):** Similar to GEGASM but without Steiner mutations, providing a more traditional genetic algorithm approach for comparison.
- **Binary-encoded Genetic Algorithm (BEGA):** An alternative genetic algorithm approach using binary encoding based on the MILP.
- **Local Search:** Iterative improvement for refining solutions.
- **CPLEX Models:** Exact mathematical programming approaches, including shortest-path and full graph optimisation.

Helper scripts are included for preprocessing data, running batch experiments, and analysing results.

The project explores deployment strategies for next-generation (B5G/6G) reconfigurable RAN and optical X-haul networks, balancing **cost, scalability, and performance**.

## Algorithms

### Greedy Algorithm

- **Purpose:** Provides a fast, heuristic-based solution for initial network configurations.
- **Advantages:** Lightweight, quick to implement, and useful as a baseline.
- **Implementation:** See [`code/greedy_solution_generator.ipynb`](code/greedy_solution_generator.ipynb).

### Graph Encoded Genetic Algorithm with Steiner Mutations (GEGASM)

- **Purpose:** Explores larger solution spaces through evolutionary optimisation.
- **Advantages:** Finds higher-quality solutions at the cost of runtime and computational resources.
- **Implementation:** See [`code/genetic_algorithm.py`](code/genetic_algorithm.py).
- **Features:**
  - Customisable crossover and mutation operators
  - Configurable selection strategies
  - Logging of population performance over time
- **Note:** For a simpler alternative, see the Binary-encoded Genetic Algorithm (BEGA) below.

### Graph Encoded Genetic Algorithm (GEGA)

- **Purpose:** Similar to GEGASM but without Steiner mutations, while still using all the core functionality of GEGASM.
- **Advantages:** Provides a more traditional genetic algorithm approach, which may be preferable in certain scenarios or for comparison purposes.
- **Implementation:** See [`code/GEGA.py`](code/GEGA.py).
- **Features:**
  - Customisable crossover and mutation operators (without Steiner mutations)
  - Configurable selection strategies
  - Logging of population performance over time
- **Note:** Used to demonstrate the impact of Steiner mutations by providing a direct comparison to GEGASM, while still leveraging the same underlying genetic algorithm framework.

### Binary-encoded Genetic Algorithm (BEGA)

- **Purpose:** An alternative genetic algorithm approach using binary encoding based on the MILP formulation.
- **Advantages:** Simpler encoding can lead to faster convergence in some cases, and may be easier to implement for certain problem structures.
- **Disadvantages:** May not capture complex solution structures as effectively as a more traditional genetic algorithm leading to suboptimal solutions in some cases.
- **Implementation:** See [`code/BEGA.py`](code/BEGA.py).

### Local Search

- **Purpose:** Provides an alternative to genetic algorithms for refining solutions via iterative improvement.
- **Advantages:** Efficient for fine-tuning and escaping local optima.
- **Implementation:** See [`code/local_search.py`](code/local_search.py).

### CPLEX Models (Exact Solution Methods)

- **CPLEX Shortest Path:** Uses mathematical programming to find exact optimal network paths.
  - **Implementation:** See [`code/CPLEX_shortest_path.py`](code/CPLEX_shortest_path.py).
- **CPLEX Graph Model:** Provides full graph-based optimisation for deployment strategies, delivering exact solutions.
  - **Implementation:** See [`code/CPLEX_graph_model.py`](code/CPLEX_graph_model.py).

## Datasets

The repository includes two datasets designed on a region within rural Australia, each tailored for different testing scenarios:

- **Full Dataset:**
  Large-scale, complex data designed to fully test algorithms and evaluate scalability.

- **Small Dataset:**
  Simplified data for debugging, quick experiments, and verifying correctness.

See the [README in `dataset/`](./dataset/README.md) for details on dataset structure and usage.

I've also released a dataset generating tool as a separate repository, which can be found [here](https://github.com/breezy-codes/B5G-network-dataset-generator). This tool allows users to create custom datasets based on specific parameters and requirements, making it easier to test algorithms under various conditions.

## Scripts and Utilities

Located in the `scripts/` directory, these tools support:

- **Dataset Updates:** Updating dataset files when changes are made.
- **Visualisation:** Viewing datasets on a map and plotting algorithm iteration results.

See the [README in `scripts/`](./scripts/README.md) for details on available scripts and their usage.

## Figures

The `figures/` folder stores images, diagrams, and charts used for documentation within this README. This includes dataset visualisations.

---

## Results

Algorithm outputs are stored under `heuristic-algorithm/results/`, with logs in `heuristic-algorithm/code/logs/`.
