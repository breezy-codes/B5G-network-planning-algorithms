# Results Folder

This folder contains the results of the network planning algorithms, including segment data and visualisations. Whenever you run the algorithms, new results will be saved here.

For visualising the maps, it will pull from the `json` files in this folder. You can change which file to load by modifying the `segment_file_name` variable in the `plot_results_graph.py` script located in the `scripts/map_builder` directory.
