# Map Visualisations

This folder contains the output of all map visualisation results generated by the project. Each file represents a different map or analysis outcome, allowing you to review, share, or further process the visualisation data.

## How Maps Are Generated

Map images and related visualisation files are produced by scripts located in the `scripts/map_builder/` directory. When you run these scripts, they automatically generate maps based on your data and analysis parameters, then save the results directly to this folder. This ensures all map outputs are organised and accessible in one place.

- Generated map images

All results are automatically saved here after running map-related scripts or analyses. Refer to the documentation in `scripts/map_builder/` for details on customising map generation and output formats.
